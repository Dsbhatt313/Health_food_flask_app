            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>The app collects user input through a multi-step form. Each section of the form gathers specific data about the user:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Select Activities:</strong> Users choose their daily activities, which help determine their activity level.</li>
                <li><strong>Activity Duration:</strong> The duration of each activity is selected, contributing to the overall activity level calculation.</li>
                <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> Users provide their gender, age, height, and weight.</li>
                <li><strong>Meal Type and Preferences:</strong> The app asks for meal types, age intervals, and any medical issues that may affect diet.</li>
                <li><strong>Ingredient Input:</strong> Users can enter ingredients they have, and the app will find matching recipes.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Based on the provided information, the app calculates the user's calorie needs and suggests recipes that fit their dietary requirements.</p>
